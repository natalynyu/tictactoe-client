# Tic Tac Toe - Client
Tic Tac Toe is a strategy game in which the objective is for the player to get three of their marks in a row (either across, straight down, or diagonally).

* Technologies Used: HTML, CSS/SASS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, AJAX/jQuery, Atom

* Development Process & Problem Solving Strategies
At the start of my project, I worked on the HTML to create a skeleton of the page. Then, I added network and user functionality to the page with JavaScript. To resolve roadblocks, I referenced online resources like the jQuery library and Stack Overflow and used the console to find where bugs were occurring. I outlined each of the functionalities needed according to the requirements and referenced this list to ensure that all requirements were met. Along the way, I tested features and recorded the bugs that I found in a list so that I could go back and fix them. 

* List unsolved problems which would be fixed in future iterations:
For future iterations, I would like to make this game multiplayer so that people from different devices can play against each other in a single game. I would also like to update the game so that players can choose their own game pieces as opposed to the default ‘x’ and ‘o.’ Lastly, I’d like to improve the code to make it more modular.
